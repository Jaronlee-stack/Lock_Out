# lock_out

FocusUp is a gamified mobile app built with Flutter that helps students manage their screen time and improve focus through engaging mechanics. The app uses the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focus, 5-minute breaks) and rewards users with XP (experience points) for completing sessions. As students accumulate XP, theyâ€™ll see a virtual tree or pet grow as a visual representation of their progress.
This is to promote healthy study habits, reduce distractions from mobile devices, and make productivity feel rewarding instead of punishing, allowing them to balance out their screentime and homework
Rather than restricting phone usage through forceful lockouts, the app rewards focus by turning study time into a game
